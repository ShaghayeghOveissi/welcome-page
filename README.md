# welcome-page-vue
This Welcome page consists of a sticky header which has 3 links, a carousel as well as a header and some random text. The design is responsive and it has been tested on different browsers.
When users scroll down the page the sticky header collapses and once the users scroll up, the sticky header appears once again.
This project has been built using Vue.js as a JavaScript framework and I have used HTML, JavaScript and SCSS in order to complete the front-end design. Bootstrap front-end framework has been used for the carousel.
